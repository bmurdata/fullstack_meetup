Our members are from all walks of life and range from established tech professionals to small business owners and students alike. We focus our classes on real life use-cases so that our curriculum works for your career goals or small business. At our structured classes, you\\u2019ll walk away with direct access to companies ready to hire, real-life job skills, online resources for studying at home, and a community with other tech-minded individuals. During our networking sessions, we connect our members directly to companies for potential hiring opportunities. Our meetings are hosted at a WeWork space (yes that means unlimited caffeine, and beer and kombucha on tap!) where we meet three times a week \\u2013 Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays. We made sure our classes work for people with a 9-5 schedule. If you\\u2019re new to Full Stack Coding, we recommend you join us on Sundays for our informal open office hours and networking session. More structured classes are also available for a small fee so that you can build your skills without breaking the bank. Check out our schedule and we hope to see you at our next Meetup! About myself: I\\u2019m Adam, a technical consultant working on enterprise applications for financial giants during the day, and owner of a successful cleaning business https://www.maidstay.com/ on the side. Most of my weekends are spent playing Super Smash Brothers and working on my Muay Thai technique. I started Full Stack Coding after feeling completely unprepared for the job market when I finished a popular coding bootcamp here in NYC, which also left me in debt. I want to help people use tech as an opportunity to get ahead in their lives the way it\\u2019s helped me. Frameworks I\\u2019m most familiar with: Frontend: Angular 2+, React, React native, Vue Backend: Laravel, Drupal, Wordpress (kind of a backend framework haha), Flask, Django, Go (language but whatever), Ruby on Rails, Node.js About the other organizers: Sina is the Director of Engineering for a tech consulting firm, owner of https://www.colorcode.io/ , and makes a mean hot toddy. His podcast, The Drunk Web, features a series of conversations with web professionals, engineers, coders, designers, managers, execs, CEOs, and all the other wonderful people who make the web every day, over several hot toddies of course.
